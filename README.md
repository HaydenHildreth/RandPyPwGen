# RandPyPwGen

## What is RandPyPwGen - WIP [Work in progress]
It's a simple and easy to use password generator and password manager that's open-source and made in Python 3.

## How to use it?
Make sure you have Python 3 or higher installed. Either clone the repository or copy the code to a notepad and save as {filename}.py. Then run the program.

## Known problems
- Very ugly
    - Will fix and update the UI/UX soon
- Need to use functions to add new node and sites
- Encryption (hashing)
- Landing/login page
